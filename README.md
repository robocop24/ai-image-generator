**Project Title: React + Vite AI Image Generator**

**Description**

This project provides a streamlined setup for developing an AI image generator using the powerful combination of React and Vite. It offers:

- **React Framework:** Build a modern and interactive user interface for users to interact with the image generation process.
- **Vite Build Tool:** Enjoy a lightning-fast development experience with hot module replacement (HMR) for seamless updates during creation.

**Key Features**

- **AI Image Generation Integration:** Integrate your preferred AI image generation API (e.g., OpenAI) to enable users to create images based on textual prompts.
- **Intuitive Interface:** Design a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input text prompts and generate corresponding images.
- **Customization Options (Optional):** Consider incorporating features that allow users to refine the generation process, such as choosing image styles, aspect ratios, or additional parameters.

**Dependencies**

- `react`
- `react-dom`
- `vite`
- `@vitejs/plugin-react` (or `@vitejs/plugin-react-swc`)

**Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-vite-ai-image-generator.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-vite-ai-image-generator
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**Development**

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will open the application in your default browser.

2. Code changes will be automatically reflected in the browser due to Vite's HMR.

**Deployment (Optional)**

1. Build the project for production:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Host the generated files in a suitable environment (e.g., static website hosting)
